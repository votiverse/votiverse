# Changelog

All notable changes to the Votiverse project.

## Phase 7: Content Architecture — March 2026

### Added
- **`@votiverse/content` package** — 13th engine package: proposal, candidacy, and community note metadata lifecycle with content hash verification (SHA-256)
- **New config parameters** — `delegationMode` (open/candidacy/none), `allowVoteChange`, `noteVisibilityThreshold`, `noteMinEvaluations`, `surveyResponseAnonymity`
- **VCP content routes** — proposals, candidacies, community notes (metadata + contentHash only; 6 new DB tables, 15 endpoints)
- **Backend content storage** — drafts, versioned content, assets (5 new DB tables); VCP-first orchestration on all writes
- **Vote transparency enforcement** — opted-in delegate candidates' votes visible to delegators under any ballot secrecy mode
- **TipTap WYSIWYG editor** — rich markdown editing with toolbar, code-split (377KB main + 931KB editor chunk)
- **Word/DOCX import** — mammoth.js integration via Import button in editor
- **Member search with candidacy discovery** — typeahead search for delegation nomination; declared candidates featured on focus in candidacy mode
- **Community notes UI** — create, endorse/dispute, visibility badges, inline on proposals and candidacies
- **Seed data** — 3 proposals, 3 candidacies, 3 notes with 9 evaluations across OSC and Youth assemblies

### Changed
- `DelegationConfig.enabled: boolean` → `delegationMode: 'open' | 'candidacy' | 'none'` (clean break, all presets/tests updated)
- `LIQUID_ACCOUNTABLE` preset now uses `delegationMode: 'candidacy'`
- Awareness layer extended: `DelegateProfile.candidacy`, `HistoricalContext.proposals`, 4 new engagement prompt reasons
- Proposal auto-locking on first vote cast (deliberation window enforcement)
- Documentation reorganized: 14 historical reports archived, whitepaper moved to `docs/papers/`

### Tests
- Engine: 459 (was 389), VCP: 107 (was 84), Backend: 63 (was 46), Web: 16 (new)
- **Total: 645 tests**

## VCP Multi-Tenancy & Backend Independence — March 2026

### Added
- **VCP client-assembly access enforcement** — `assemblyAccess` on `ClientInfo` (`readonly string[] | "*"`), enforced by `requireAssemblyAccess()` path-scoped middleware on all assembly routes
- **VCP scope gates** — admin write operations (POST participants/events/polls/topics, DELETE participants) require `"operational"` scope; participant-only keys cannot create or delete resources
- **VCP auto-link on create** — `POST /assemblies` automatically grants the creating client access to the new assembly
- **VCP token exchange validation** — `POST /auth/token` rejects clients without access to the target assembly
- **Backend assembly cache** — `assemblies_cache` table, `AssemblyCacheService` with upsert/get/listByIds, `GET /assemblies` and `GET /assemblies/:id` served from local cache (no VCP round-trip)
- **Backend topic cache** — `topics_cache` table, `TopicCacheService`, `GET /assemblies/:id/topics` served from local cache, populated on proxy intercept
- **Backend PostgreSQL adapter** — full schema with all 8 tables, wired via `BACKEND_DATABASE_URL` env var, SQLite fallback when not set
- 13 new VCP tests (client-assembly access + scope gates), 5+ new backend tests (assembly cache)

### Changed
- `GET /assemblies` filtered by client's `assemblyAccess` at VCP level
- Backend `GET /assemblies`, `GET /assemblies/:id`, `GET /assemblies/:id/topics` no longer proxy to VCP
- `SimpleAuthAdapter` loads and enforces `assemblyAccess` from config and DB
- Backend seed script fetches full assembly details and populates local cache
- Assembly cache upsert uses standard `ON CONFLICT` syntax (works on both SQLite and PostgreSQL)

## Time-Based Lifecycle Management — March 2026

### Added
- `TimeProvider` interface in `@votiverse/core` — injectable time source for all time-dependent operations
- `TestClock` class — controllable clock with `advance(ms)`, `set(ms)`, `reset()` for testing
- `systemTime` default provider — uses `Date.now()` for production
- Timeline enforcement in engine's `voting.cast()` — rejects votes outside `votingStart`–`votingEnd` window
- Dev test clock API in VCP (`GET/POST /dev/clock/*`) — Stripe-style time control for lifecycle testing
- Double-gated safety: dev routes not mounted in production + middleware guard as fallback
- Smart datetime display in web UI — shows time component when not midnight

### Changed
- `VotiverseEngine` accepts optional `timeProvider` in `EngineOptions`
- VCP `AssemblyManager` exposes `timeProvider` field, passed to engine instances
- VCP event status and tally routes use `manager.timeProvider.now()` instead of `Date.now()`
- All VCP and engine tests updated to use `TestClock` with proper timeline windows

## Client Backend (Phases 1–6) — March 2026

### Added
- `platform/backend/` service — Hono HTTP server on port 4000 with SQLite persistence

- Login form in web client replacing static identity picker

### Changed
- Web client migrated from direct VCP connection to backend proxy (port 4000)
- Removed `identity-store.ts`, `VITE_API_KEY`, and client-side `X-Participant-Id` injection

## Deployment Hardening (Phases A–D) — March 2026

### Added
- Web client env var support (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`)
- VCP production config validation (fail-fast when `VCP_CORS_ORIGINS` not set)
